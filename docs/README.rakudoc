=head1 NAME

B<IO::Stem> - Provides the part of an IO.basename left with the IO.extension removed

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
use IO::Stem;
say "finance.data".IO.stem;     # OUTPUT: «finance␤»
# aliases for method 'stem':
say "finance.data".IO.barename; # OUTPUT: «finance␤»
say "finance.data".IO.name;     # OUTPUT: «finance␤»
say "finance.data".IO.filename; # OUTPUT: «finance␤»
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Class IO::Stem> is an extension of core class C<IO::Path> which
currently has no method to provide that part of a basename remaining
after its extension is removed.  Its methods are intended to be
candidates for inclusion in the next major release of Raku.  Each
method name has been found to be used for the same purpose in several
well-known domains including C<make>, C<LaTeX>, and C<shell>.

For heavier work on paths it is easier to get a new B<IO::Stem> object
and save some keystrokes. The same results shown in the code
block above can be expressed as follows:

=begin code :lang<raku>
use IO::Stem;
my $o = IO::Stem.new: "finance.data";
say $o.stem;     # OUTPUT: «finance␤»
# aliases for method 'stem':
say $o.barename; # OUTPUT: «finance␤»
say $o.name;     # OUTPUT: «finance␤»
say $o.filename; # OUTPUT: «finance␤»
=end code
